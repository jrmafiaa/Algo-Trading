This program is written to trade stocks 

#### Collecting Data 
The first step in the programm is that we will collect data from diffrent stocks. Unfrurtnally we don't have a Key to provide the programm with real time data from a tool like quandl. That's why it is more focused on past decisions. 

#### Dow Jones Stocks 


#### Momentum Strategy 
The momentum strategy is first used by Richard Driehaus. The Key behind this strategy is to buy stocks if they in the rising and sell them if they reached their peak. To reconise those trends the trader have to find signals for buy and sell actions. 

#### Backtester
